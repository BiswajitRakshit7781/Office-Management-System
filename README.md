Office Management System
This repository contains the source code for a web-based Office Management System (OMS), a collaborative project developed by a group of students. This system aims to streamline and automate various administrative tasks within an office environment.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP, MySQL
Features:

User Management: Create and manage user accounts with different access levels.
Task Management: Create, assign, and track tasks with deadlines and status updates.
Employee Management: Store and manage employee information, including contact details and department assignments.
Meeting Management: Schedule meetings, manage attendees, and reserve rooms.
Resource Management: Track and manage office resources like equipment and meeting rooms. (Optional)
Reporting: Generate reports on employee performance, task completion, and resource utilization. (Optional)
Implementation:

The frontend utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements.
The backend employs PHP for server-side scripting and interacting with the MySQL database.
The MySQL database stores and manages data related to users, tasks, employees, meetings, and resources (if implemented).
Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., PHP, MySQL).
Configure the database connection details in the appropriate configuration file.
Run the application using a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and may require further development for production use.

Additional Information:

Feel free to explore the codebase and understand the implementation further.
We welcome suggestions and contributions to improve the system.
